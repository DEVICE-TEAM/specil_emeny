Hello!

Legit, do not take any of this as an example for anything. A lot of the original work here is spaghetti code I am not very proud of, lol. Feel free to commit with any changes you'd like to see to the game and I'll consider it! I'm just taking a break right now because this made October very difficult for me, haha.

Libraries are *not* included because I don't wanna re-distribute others' work unless it's in the actual mod itself, but if you wanna tinker around with SPECIL EMENY, you can get those from [the main release on GameJolt](https://gamejolt.com/games/specil-emeny/1003826).

**[The Entire Kristal Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/8ZGuKXJE2C)**  
I literally would not have been able to do anything without the absolute glut of knowledge there on lua and Kristal's engine.

### Inspiration & Special Thanks
**Random Shit On The Internet**  
Self explanatory

**[Dorked](https://www.youtube.com/@Dorked) / [Inverted Fate](https://invertedfate.com)**  
Inverted Fate's take on the Memoryheads was a big inspiration to their appearance in SPECIL EMENY and ROSY-TROVE, and Inverted Fate in general has been a super early inspiration to The Stranger not only in the UT/DR space but in general.

**[Beethovenus](https://beethovenus.carrd.co/) / [TS!UNDERSWAP](https://gamejolt.com/games/tsunderswap/160094)**  
Section 2 of TS!UNDERSWAP reignited The Stranger's UT/DR interest.

**[Toby Fox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toby_Fox) / The DELTARUNE Team**  
For UNDERTALE and DELTARUNE.
